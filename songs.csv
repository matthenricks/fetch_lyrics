starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know youve been high when youre feeling low Only hate the road when youre missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go  Staring at the bottom of your glass Hoping one day youll make a dream last But dreams come slow and they go so fast You see her when you close your eyes Maybe one day youll understand why Everything you touch oh it dies  But you only need the light when its burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know youve been high when youre feeling low Only hate the road when youre missing home Only know you love her when you let her go  Staring at the ceiling in the dark Same old empty feeling in your heart Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast Well you see her when you fall asleep But never to touch and never to keep Cause you loved her too much and you dive too deep  Well you only need the light when its burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know youve been high when youre feeling low Only hate the road when youre missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go Oh oh oh no And you let her go Oh oh oh no Well you let her go  Cause you only need the light when its burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know youve been high when youre feeling low Only hate the road when youre missing home Only know you love her when you let her go  Cause you only need the light when its burning low Only miss the sun when it starts to snow Only know you love her when you let her go Only know youve been high when youre feeling low Only hate the road when youre missing home Only know you love her when you let her go And you let her go,,,,4,Bastille,Pompeii,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/bastille/pompeii-lyrics/29478793,I was left to my own devices Many days fell away with nothing to show  And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all And if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Youve been here before How am I gonna be an optimist about this How am I gonna be an optimist about this  We were caught up and lost in all of our vices In your pose as the dust settles around us  And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all And if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Youve been here before How am I gonna be an optimist about this How am I gonna be an optimist about this  Oh where do we begin The rubble or our sins Oh where do we begin The rubble or our sins  And the walls kept tumbling down In the city that we love Great clouds roll over the hills Bringing darkness from above  But if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Nothing changed at all And if you close your eyes Does it almost feel like Youve been here before How am I gonna be an optimist about this How am I gonna be an optimist about this  If you close your eyes does it almost feel like nothing changed at

throw my hands up in the air So there Im kind of older than I was when I reveled without a care So there  We live in cities youll never see onscreen Not very pretty but we sure know how to run things

blue sky Shinning off the cross hanging from the mirror of my ride Breeze blowing in your hair blowing round Youre scanning through the stations looking for that country sound The good stuff iced up in the back seat Nowhere to go nowhere to be  I got my shades on top back Rolling with the music jacked One on the wheel one around you baby Sunset I bet Theres a chance we can get Sure enough Tangled

To kids from one to ninetytwo  Although its been said Many times Many ways Merry Christmas to you   And so Im offering this simple phrase  To kids from one to ninetytwo  Although its been said Many

Hayes,Invisible,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/hunter-hayes/invisible-lyrics/30765610,Crowded hallways are the loneliest places For outcasts and rebels Or anyone who just dares to be different And youve been trying for so long To find out where your place is But in their narrow minds Theres no room for anyone who dares to do something different Oh but listen for a minute  Trust the one Whos been where you are wishing all it was Was sticks and stones Those words cut deep but they dont mean youre all alone And youre not invisible Hear me out Theres so much more to life than what youre feeling now Someday youll look back on all these days And all this pain is gonna be invisible Oh invisible  So your confidence is quiet To them quiet looks like weakness But you dont have to fight it Cause youre strong enough to win without a war Every heart has a rhythm Let yours beat out so loudly That everyone can hear it Yeah I promise you dont need to hide it anymore Oh and never be afraid of doing something different Dare to be something more  Trust the one Whos been where you are wishing all it was Was sticks and stones Yeah the words cut deep but they dont mean youre all alone And youre not invisible Hear me out Theres so much more of this life than what youre feeling now And someday youll look back on all these days And all this pain is gonna be invisible  These labels that they give you just cause they dont understand If you look past this moment Youll see youve got a friend Waving a flag for who you are And all youre gonna do Yeah so heres to you And heres to anyone whos ever felt invisible  Yeah and youre not invisible Hear me out Theres so much more to life than what youre feeling now And someday youll look back on all these days And all this pain is gonna be invisible Itll be invisible,,,,76,Trey Songz,Na Na,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/trey-songz/na-na-lyrics/30927234,Put your hands in the air the air Trigga put your put your hands in the air  Ooh na na Look what

sergeant but the stress that weighing on your brain It was Me OBoog and Yaya YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans It got ugly waving your hand out the window Check yo self Uh warriors and Conans Hope euphoria

saying that he did it But ever since that day I was lookin at him different That was back when I was nine Joey packed the nine Pakistan on every porch is fine We adapt to crime pack a van with four guns at a time With the sliding door fuck is up Fuck you shootin for if you aint walkin up you fuckin punk Pickin up the fuckin pump Pickin off you suckers suck a dick or die or sucker punch A wall of

about the street It aint nothin but a Compton thang Chyea How we do  Fresh outta school cause I was a high school grad Sleeping in the living room in my mommas pad Reality struck I seen the white car crash Hit the light pole two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed My Pops said I needed a job I thought I believed him Security guard for a month and ended up leaving In fact I got fired because I was inspired by all of my friends To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in Projects tore up gang signs get thrown up Cocaine laced in marijuana And they wonder why I rarely smoke now Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth I was straight tweaking the next weekend we broke even I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding You know the reasons but still wont ever know my life Kendrick AKA Comptons human sacrifice  Cocaine weed Niggas been mixing shit since the 80s loc Sherm sticks butt nakeds Make a nigga flip Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit One times crooked and shit Block a nigga in Alondra Rosecrans Bullis Im still in the hood Loc yeah thats cool The hood took me under so I follow the rules But yeah thats like me I grew up in the hood where they bang And niggas that rep colors is doing the same thing Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me A couple drivebys in the hood lately Couple of IVs with the fucking spray can Shots in the crowd then everybody ran Crew Im finna slay the street life I crave Shots hit the enemy harsh turn brave Mount up regulators in the whip Down the boulevard with the pistol grip Trip we in the hood still So loc grab a strap cause yeah its so real Deal with the outcome a strap in the hand And a bird and ten grands where motherfuckers stand  If I told you I killed a nigga at 16 would you believe me Or see me to be innocent Kendrick that you seen in the street With a basketball and some Now  Laters to eat If I mentioned all of my skeletons would you jump in the seat Would you say my intelligence now is great relief And its safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor Instead of boy with a chopper that hold the cul de sac hostage Kill them all if they gossip the Children of the Corn They realizing the option of living a lie drown their body with toxins Constantly drinking and drive hit the powder then watch this flame That arrive in his eye this a coward the concept is aim and They bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits And the price on his head the tithes probably go to the projects I live inside the belly of

lost Ive loved and Ive lost  Explosions on the day you wake up Needing somebody and youve learned Its okay to be afraid But it will never be the same It will never be the same  You left my soul bleeding in the dark So you could be king The rules you set are still untold to me and I  Lost my faith in everything The nights you could cope your intentions were gold But the mountains will shake I

to sink I was the last thing on your mind I know you better than you think Cause its simple darling I gave you a warning Now everything you own is falling from the sky in pieces So watch them fall with you in slow motion I pray that you will find peace of mind And Ill find you another time Ill love you another time  Explosions on the day you wake up Needing somebody and youve learned Its okay to be afraid But it will never be the same,,,,97,Lorde,Glory And Gore,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/lorde/glory-and-gore-lyrics/30309793,Theres a humming in the restless summer air And were slipping

fucked up And mom I know hes not around But dont you place the blame on me As you pour yourself another drink and  I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far  I went in headfirst Never thinking about who what I said hurt in what verse My mom probably got it the worst The brunt of it but as stubborn as we are Did I take it too far Cleaning out my closet and all them other songs But regardless I dont hate you cause ma Youre still beautiful to me cause youre my mom Though far be it for you to be calling my house was Vietnam Desert Storm and both of us put together  Can form an atomic bomb equivalent to chemical warfare And forever we can drag this on and on But agree to disagree That gift from me up under the Christmas tree dont mean shit to me Youre kicking me out Its fifteen degrees and its Christmas Eve little prick just leave Ma let me grab my fucking coat anything to have each others goats Why we always at each others throats Especially when dad he fucked us both Were in the same fucking boat youd think that itd make us close nope Further away that drove us but together headlights shine a car full of belongings Still got a ways to go back to grandmas house its straight up the road And I was the man of the house the oldest so my shoulders carried the weight of the load Then Nate got taken away by the state at eight years old and Thats when I realized you were sick and it wasnt fixable or changeable And to this day we remained estranged and I hate it though but  I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far  Cause to this day we remain estranged and I hate it though Cause you aint even get to witness your grand babys growth But Im sorry mama for Cleaning Out My Closet at the time I was angry Rightfully maybe so never meant that far to take it though cause Now I know its not your fault and Im not making jokes That song I no longer play at shows and I cringe every time its on the radio And I think of Nathan being placed in a home And all the medicine you fed us And how I just wanted you to taste your own but Now the medications taken over and your mental states deteriorating slow And Im way too old to cry that shits painful though But ma I forgive you so does Nathan yo All you did all you said you did your best to raise us both Foster care that cross you bare few may be as heavy as yours But I love you Debbie Mathers oh what a tangled web we have cause One thing I never asked was where the fuck my deadbeat dad was Fuck it I guess he had trouble keeping up with every address But Id have flipped every mattress every rock and desert cactus Own a collection of maps and followed my kids to the edge of the atlas Someone ever moved them from me That you could bet your asss If I had to come down the chimney dressed as Santa kidnap them And although one has met their grandma Once you pulled up in our drive one night as we were leaving to get some hamburgers Me her and Nate we introduced you hugged you And as you left I had this overwhelming sadness come over me As we pulled off to go our separate paths and I saw your headlights as I looked back And Im mad I didnt get the chance to thank you for being my Mom and my Dad So Mom please accept this as a tribute I wrote this on the jet I guess I had to get this off my chest I hope I get the chance to lay it before Im dead The stewardess said to fasten my seat belt I guess were crashing So if Im not dreaming I hope you get this message that Ill always love you from afar Cause youre my mama  I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far  I want a new life One without a cause So Im coming home tonight Well no matter what the cost And if the plane goes down Or if the crew cant wake me up Just know that I was alright And I was not afraid to die  Oh even if theres songs to sing My children will carry me Just know that Im alright I was not afraid to die Because I put my faith in my new girl So I never say goodbye cruel world Just know that Im alright I am not afraid to die  I guess we are who we are Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on Maybe we took this too far I want a new life,,,,121,Sara Evans,Slow Me Down,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/sara-evans/slow-me-down-lyrics/30512349,Wheels are turning in my

Doe,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/priscilla-and-b-o-b/john-doe-lyrics/30316209,Seems like your heart stops working The minute they close the curtain You take off your mask And take off your costume And if anyone asks youre taking a smoke break Drinking some coffee But everyone knows what youre doing Seems like the bus moves slower Just cause you got somewhere to go So you take a few pills in Beverly Hills But if anyone asks youve got a prescription You got an addiction Who do you think that youre fooling  John Doe I just want the John I know Once you put the drinks on hold Maybe you could come back home John Doe ooh oh oh oooh Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh  Errybodys addicted to something Errybody gotta grip onto something Even if its just to feel the response of appeal Maybe once maybe twice Maybe hundreds of times hundreds of times Without it its just harder to function at times You race to the bottom of every single bottle As if there was someone or something to find Youre struggling in your mind And you tell yourself lie after lie Til you get to the point where its no longer private That people that you work with noticed the signs When you walk in the room It gets noticeably quiet So you break up the silence you say youve been at the gym But the way look cant blame on the diet So what you hiding  John Doe I just want the John I know Once you put the drinks on hold Maybe you could come back home John Doe ooh oh oh oooh Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh Oooh oh oh ohooh oooh  Yeah Ive probably had too many things Smashed too many freaks Had too much to droI mean Had too much to drink Left the club ended up in custody Random drug test passed it luckily My girl broke up wit me cause she walked in suddenly With a woman up under me I told her Wait It aint what it look like I mustve slip and fell clumsy me Well at least I admit it cause the worst you could do Is to do it and not be man enough to say that you did it Thats just how you prevent it well I aint no different I love all the money the fame And the parties with beautiful women I spend so much time as an underground artist Cause I was afraid to succumb to the business And what Id become But that what youd judge I become The path with the greatest resistance Thats how the tables can turn when they pivot And change you perspective and flip your entire position My whole life Ive been dying to wish and to live and experience Everything possible When I told em my dreams they just said they aint logical Now I can see it its optical optical  John Doe I just want the John I know Once you put

To hold your body close Take another step into the nomanâ€™s land For the longest time lady  I need you darling Come on set the tone If you feel youâ€™re falling Wonâ€™t you let me know oh Oh ooh If you love me come on get involved Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh Oh ooh  Sing oh oh Oh oh Louder oh oh Sing oh oh  This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the stage And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know But something to drink and maybe something to smoke Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local raid no I donâ€™t really know what Iâ€™m supposed to say  But I can just figure it out and hope and pray I told them my name and said itâ€™s nice to meet ya  Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila I already know sheâ€™s a keeper Just from this one small act of kindness Iâ€™m in deep If anybody finds out Iâ€™m meant to drive home  But Iâ€™m drunk and gonna live it now no We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now sheâ€™s kissing my mouth  I need you darling Come on set the tone If you feel youâ€™re falling Wonâ€™t you let me know oh Oh  If you love me come on get involved Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe oh  Oh   Sing oh oh Oh oh Louder oh oh Sing oh oh  Can you feel it  All the guys in here donâ€™t really wanna dance Can you feel it  All that I can hear is music from the back Can you feel it  Found you hiding here so hoped youd take my hand darling Before the beats kicks in again Can you feel it oh Can you feel it oh no no no  Sing I need you darling Come on set the tone If you feel youâ€™re falling Wonâ€™t you let me know louder oh Oh  Sing If you love me come on get involved Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe louder oh Oh  Sing,,,,141,Pitbull,We Are One (Ole Ola) [The 2014 FIFA World Cup Official Song],,,,,,142,KCamp,Cut Her Off,,,,,,143,Katy

below Keep careful watch of my brothers souls And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke Keep watching over Durins son  If this is to end in fire Then we should all burn together Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out for the rope sent by and we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side hey  And if we should die tonight Then we should all die together Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out for the rope Prepare as we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees And I see fire hollowing souls And I see fire blood in the breeze And I hope that youll remember me  Oh should my people fall Then surely Ill do the same Confined in mountain halls We got too close to the flame Calling out father hold fast and we will Watch the flames burn on and on the mountain side Desolation comes upon the sky  Now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees And I see fire hollowing souls And I see fire blood in the breeze And I hope that youll remember me  And if the night is burning I will cover my eyes For if the dark returns then My brothers will die And as the skys falling down It crashed into this lonely town And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out  Now I see fire inside the mountain I see fire burning the trees And I see fire hollowing souls And I see fire blood in the breeze  I see fire oh you know I saw a city burning fire And I see fire feel the heat upon my skin fire And I see fire fire And I see fire burn on and on and mountains side,,,,185,Dierks Bentley,Drunk On A Plane,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/dierks-bentley/drunk-on-a-plane-lyrics/30471079,I took two weeks vacation for

kinda like a shot She said I saw you comin over I already thought it over And OK so now what  And I said well I got a car she said theres something At least its a start I said its better than nothing I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are And she said where do you think all this is going I said there aint no way of knowing I guess I hadnt thought it through that far But I got a car  So we let the wheels turn and the windows down We let ourselves go all the way through town She never said stop and I never asked her why We drove into the night when outta nowhere She said Id give anything to never go back there And I kinda wish this day would never end She said I could use a change but I dont even know where  And I said well I got a car she said theres something At least its a start I said its better than nothing I aint in no hurry but Im ready when you are And she said where do you think all this is going I said there aint no way of knowing I really hadnt thought it through that far And I cant promise you the moon and stars But I got a car  We got lost in the miles lost track of the days Til we finally found a stopping place When the doctors said you know whats on the way And we found ourselves in a little white house One Sunday morning rain pouring down She said I think its time but all the lines are out  And her eyes teared up and she said what are we gonna do now And I said well I got a car she said theres something You think itll start I said its already running Got your things in the back and Im ready when you are She said are you sure itll get us where were goin I said if theres one thing I know girl its gotten us this far And I dont mean to hurry but Im ready when you are,,,,206,Tim McGraw,Meanwhile Back At Mama's,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/tim-mcgraw/meanwhile-back-at-mama-s-lyrics/30784053,Running round in this new truck Bank lets me borrow from month to month Running out of credit and find a little cash on the radio  Standing still theyre blowing past Numbers on cars going Nascar fast  What I wouldnt give for a slow down dont you know Cause where I come from only the horses run When the day is done we take it easy  Meanwhile back at Mamas  The porch lights on come on in if you wanna Suppers on the stove and beers in the fridge Red sun sinking out low on the ridge Games on the tube and daddy smoked cigarettes Whiskey keeps his whistle wet Funny the things you thought youd never miss  In a world gone crazy as this  Well I found a girl and we dont fit in here Talk about how hard it is to breathe here Even with the windows down cant catch a southern breeze here One of these days gonna pack it up and leave here  Cause meanwhile back at Mamas  The porch lights on come on in if you wanna Suppers on the stove and beers in the fridge Red sun sinking out low on the ridge Games on the tube and daddy smoked cigarettes Whiskey keeps his whistle wet Funny the things you thought youd never miss In a world gone crazy as this  Oh I miss yeah a little dirt on the road I miss corn growing in a row I miss being somebody everybody knows there Everybody knows everybody I miss those small town roots Walking around in muddy boots The sound of rain on an old tin roof Its time we head on back  Cause meanwhile back at Mamas The for sale signs going up and Im gonna Dump this truck and the little Ive got  On a loan to own and a 3 acre lot Put supper on the stove and beer in the fridge Going for broke yeah were gonna be rich Watch the sun settin on the ridge  Baby tell me whatcha think about this  Me and you back at Mamas  Yeah me and you back at Mamas,,,,207,Charli XCX,Boom Clap,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/charli-xcx/boom-clap-lyrics/30828391,Boom boom boom clap  Youre picture perfect

disappear I told her Im not really looking for another mistake I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn But I gave her my time for two or three nights Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again She told me I was never looking for a friend Maybe you can swing by my room around ten Baby bring the lemon and a bottle of gin Well be in between the sheets till the late AM Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said Shes singing  Dont fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my own I dont wanna know that babe Dont fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe  For a couple of weeks I only want to see her We drink away the days with a take away pizza Before a text message was the only way to reach her Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature And never wants to sleep I guess that I dont want to either But me and her we make money the same way Four cities two planes the same day And those shows have never been what its about Maybe well go together and just figure it out Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch But we should get on the plane or well be missing it now Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out When she was kissing him how I was confused about She should figure it out Why Im sat here singing  Dont fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my own I dont wanna know that babe Dont fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe  On my hotel door I dont even know if she knows what for She was crying on my shoulder I already told you Trust and respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next But you didnt need to to take him to bed thats all And I never saw him as a threat Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course Its not like we were both on tour We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor And I wasnt looking for a promise or commitment But it was never just fun and I thought you were different This is not the way you realize that you want it Its a bit too much too late if Im honest And all this time God knows Im singing  Dont fuck with my love That heart is so cold All over my own I dont wanna know that babe Dont fuck with my love I told her she knows Take aim and reload I dont wanna know that babe  Dont fuck with my love That heart is so cold

at all  I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didnt need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape  Cause Im not fine at all  The pictures that you sent me theyre still living in my phone Ill admit I like to see them Ill admit I feel alone And all my friends keep asking why Im not around  It hurts to know youre happy yeah it hurts that youve moved on Its hard to hear your name when I havent seen you in so long  Its like we never happened was it just a lie If what we had was real how could you be fine  Cause Im not fine at all  I remember

with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it felt to fall asleep next to you And the memories I never can escape  If today I woke up with you right beside me Like all of this was just some twisted dream Id hold you closer than I ever did before And youd never slip away And youd never hear me say  I remember the day you told me you were leaving I remember the makeup running down your face And the dreams you left behind you didnt need them Like every single wish we ever made I wish that I could wake up with amnesia And forget about the stupid little things Like the way it

And sang a different song Iâ€™ll love her till my last breaths gone Like a river made of silver Everyone came running to the scene I was shot down in cold blood By an angel in blue jeans  Late that night she got away I chased her to the turnpike Then lost her where the music never plays And though I rolled upon the stones and fell into the water Iâ€™ll love her till my judgment day Like a sunrise made of white lies Everything was nothing as it seems I was shot down in cold blood By an angel in blue jeans  I hear voices calling all around I keep falling down I think my heart could pound right out of me I see a million different ways To never leave this maze alive  I woke up in somebodyâ€™s arms Strange and so familiar Where nothing could go wrong Barely alive or nearly dead Somehow awake in my own bed And there you are Like a highway headed my way Life is but a dream I was shot down by your love My angel in blue jeans oh,,,,303,Lil Jon,Bend Ova,,,,,,304,Meghan Trainor,Dear

Wanted to be left alone in public excuse me Been wanting my cake and eat it too and wanting it both ways Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated When I blew see it was confusing Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf Abused ink used it as a tool when I blew steam Woo Hit the lottery oh wee With what I gave up to get was bittersweet With this like winning a huge meet

onto Jeff VanVonderen Cause I need an interventionist To intervene between me and this monster And save me from myself and all this conflict Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I cant conquer it My OCD is conking me in the head Keep knocking nobodys home Im sleepwalking Im just relaying what the voice in my heads saying Dont shoot the messenger Im just friends with the  Im friends

back to the days that I get on a Dre track Give every kid who got played at Pumped up feeling and shit to say back To the kids who played em I aint here to save the fucking children But if one kid out of a hundred million Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates thats great Its payback Russell Wilson falling way back In the draft turn nothing into something still can make that Straw into gold chump I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack Maybe I need a straight jacket face facts I am nuts for real but Im okay with that Its nothing Im still friends with the  Im friends with the

cards all fold And the saints we see Are all made of gold  When your dreams all fail And the ones we hail Are the worst of all And the bloodâ€™s run stale  I wanna hide the truth I wanna shelter you But with the beast inside Thereâ€™s nowhere we can hide  No matter what we breed We still are made of greed This is my kingdom come This is my kingdom come  When you feel my heat Look into my eyes Itâ€™s where my demons hide Itâ€™s where my demons hide Donâ€™t get too close Itâ€™s dark inside Itâ€™s where my demons hide Itâ€™s where my demons hide  Curtainâ€™s call Is the last of all When the lights fade out All the sinners crawl  So they dug your grave And the masquerade Will come calling out At the mess youve made  Dont wanna let you down But I am hell bound Though this is all for you Dont wanna hide the truth  No matter what we breed We still are made of greed This is my kingdom come This is my kingdom come  When you feel my heat Look into my eyes Itâ€™s where my demons hide Itâ€™s where my demons hide Donâ€™t get too close Itâ€™s dark inside Itâ€™s where my demons hide Itâ€™s where my demons hide  They say its what you make I say its up to fate Its woven in my soul I need to let you go  Your eyes they shine so bright I wanna save that light I cant escape this now Unless you show me how  When you feel my heat Look into my eyes Itâ€™s where my demons hide Itâ€™s where my demons hide Donâ€™t get too close Itâ€™s dark inside Itâ€™s where my demons hide Itâ€™s where my demons hide,,,,370,Drake,Started From The Bottom,,,,,,371,Swedish House Mafia,Don't You

people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box They said I rap like a robot so call me Rapbot  But for me to rap like a computer must be in my genes I got a laptop in my back pocket My penll go off when I halfcock it Got a fat knot from that rap profit Made a living and a killing off it Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office With Monica Lewinsky feeling on his nutsack Im an MC still as honest But as rude and indecent as all hell syllables killaholic Kill em all with This slickety gibbedy hibbedy hip hop You dont really wanna get into a pissing match with this rappidy rap Packing a Mac in the back of the Ac pack backpack rap yep yackidyyac The exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts while Im practicing  That Ill still be able to break a motherfuckin table Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half Only realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact How could I not blow All I do is drop Fbombs feel my wrath of attack Rappers are having a rough time period heres a Maxipad Its actually disastrously bad  For the wack while Im masterfully constructing this masterpiece as  Im beginning to feel like a Rap God Rap God All my people from the front to the back nod back nod Now who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box slap box Let me show you maintaining this shit aint that hard that hard  Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality like I have got Well to be truthful the blueprints simply rage and youthful exuberance Everybody loves to root for a nuisance Hit the earth like an asteroid did nothing but shoot for the moon since MCs get taken to school with this music Cause I use it as a vehicle to bust a rhyme Now I lead a new school full of students Me Im a product of Rakim Lakim Shabazz 2Pac N WA Cube hey Doc Ren Yella Eazy thank you they got Slim Inspired enough to one day grow up blow up and be in a position To meet Run DMC and induct them into the motherfuckin Rock n Roll Hall of Fame Even though I walk in the church and burst in a ball of flames Only Hall of Fame I be inducted in is the alcohol of fame On the wall of shame You

I do though For good at least once in a while So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case cause even you unsigned Rappers are hungry looking at me like its lunchtime I know there was a time where once I Was king of the underground but I still rap like Im on my Pharoahe Monch grind So I crunch rhymes but sometimes when you combine Appeal with the skin color of mine You get too big and here they come trying to  Censor you like that one line

Rapunzel with fucking cornrows Youre like normal fuck being normal And I just bought a new Raygun from the future To just come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhetherâ€™s pad Singin to a man while they played piano Man oh man that was a 247 special on the cable channel So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day Hey Fab

So that anything you saying ricocheting off of me and itll glue to you Im never stating more than never demonstrating How to give a motherfuckin audience a feeling like its levitating Never fading and I know that the haters are forever waiting For the day that they can say I fell off theyd be celebrating Cause I know the way to get em motivated I make elevating music you make elevator music Oh hes too mainstream Well thats what they do when they get jealous they confuse it Its not hip hop its pop cause I found a hella way to fuse it With rock shock rap with Doc Throw on Lose Yourself and make em lose it I dont know how to make songs like that I dont know what words to use Let me know when it occurs to you While Iâ€™m ripping any one of these verses diverse as you Itâ€™s curtains Iâ€™m inadvertently hurtin you How many verses I gotta murder to  Prove that if youre half as nice at songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh School flunkie pill junky But look at the accolades the skills brung me Full of myself but still hungry I bully myself cause I make me do what I put my mind to And Im a million leagues above you ill when I speak in tongues But its still tongue in cheek fuck you Im drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel Im asleep in the front seat Bumping Heavy D and the Boys still chunky but funky But in my head theres something I can feel tugging and struggling Angels fight with devils heres what they want from me They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred that I had Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation And understand the discrimination But fuck it lifes handing you lemons make lemonade then But if I cant batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake

was gay cause I could draw  My uncle was and I kept my room straight I told my mom tears rushing down my face shes like  Ben youve loved girls since before preK Trippin yeah I guess she had a point didnt she A bunch of stereotypes all in my head I remember doing the math like Yeah Im good a little league A preconceived idea of what it all meant For those who like the same sex had the characteristics The rightwing conservatives think its a decision And you can be cured with some treatment and religion Manmade rewiring of a predisposition Playing God Ahh nah here we go America the brave Still fears what we dont know And God loves all his children its somehow forgotten But we paraphrase a book written 3500 hundred years ago I dont know  And I cant change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  If I was gay I would think hiphop hates me Have you read the Youtube comments lately Man thats gay Gets dropped on the daily Weve become so numb to what were sayin Our culture founded from oppression Yeah we dont have acceptance for em Call each other faggots behind the keys of a message board A word routed in hate yet our genre still ignores it Gay is synonymous with the lesser Its the same hate thats caused wars from religion Gender to skin color the complexion of your pigment The same fight that lead people to walkouts and sitins  Its human rights for everybody There is no difference Live on And be yourself When I was in church they taught me something else If you preach hate at the service Those words arent anointed And that Holy Water that you soak in is then poisoned When everyone else Is more comfortable remaining voiceless Rather than fighting for humans that have had their rights stolen I might not be the same But thats not important No freedom til were equal Damn right I support it  I dont know  And I cant change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  We press play Dont press pause Progress march on With a veil over our eyes We turn our back on the cause Till the day That my uncles can be united by law Their kids are walkin around the hallway Plagued by pain in their heart A world so hateful some would rather die than be who they are And a certificate on paper Isnt gonna solve it all but its a damn good place to start No laws gonna change us We have to change us Whatever God you believe in We come from the same one Strip away the fear Underneath its all the same love About time that we raised up  And I cant change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to And I cant change Even if I tried Even if I wanted to My love my love my love She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm She keeps me warm  Love is patient love is kind Love is patient  Love is kind Not crying on Sundays  Love is

Lights gone days end Struggling to pay rent Long nights strange men  And they say Shes in the class A team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen But lately her face seems Slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries  And they scream  The worst things in life come free to us  Cause were just under the upper hand  And go mad for a couple grams And she dont want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the motherland Or sells love to another man Its too cold outside For angels to fly for angels to fly  Ripped gloves raincoat  Tried to swim and stay afloat Dry house wet clothes  Loose change bank notes Wearyeyed dry throat Call girl no phone  And they say Shes in the class A team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen  But lately her face seems Slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries  And they scream  The worst things in life come free to us  Cause were just under the upper hand  And go mad for a couple grams But she dont want to go outside tonight And in a pipe she flies to the motherland Or sells love to another man Its too cold outside For angels to fly An angel will die Covered in white  Closed eye And hoping for a better life This time well fade out tonight  Straight down the line  And they say Shes in the class A team Stuck in her daydream Been this way since eighteen  But lately her face seems Slowly sinking wasting Crumbling like pastries  They scream  The worst things in life come free to us  And were under the upper hand  And go mad for a couple grams And we dont want to go outside tonight And in the pipe fly to the

like I might just give up eh you mightve mistook Me for bowing out I aint taking a bow Im stabbing myself With a fucking knife in the gut while Im wiping my butt Cause I just shitted on the mic and I like getting cut I get excited at the sight of my blood youre in a fight with a nut Cause Imma fight til I die or win Biting the dust itll just make me angrier wait Let me remind you of what got me this far picture me quitting Now draw a circle around it and put a line through it slut Its survival of what  This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all so take it all So take it all  So get your ideas stack your ammo But dont come unless you come to battle Im mad now jump in the saddle This is it its what you eat sleep piss and shit Live breathe your whole existence just consists of this Refuse to quit fuse is lit cant defuse the wick I dont do this music shit I lose my shit Aint got shit to lose its the moment of truth Its all I know how to do as soon as I get thrown in the booth I spit But my respect is overdue Im showing you the flow no one do Cause I dont own no diploma for school I quit So theres nothing for me to fall back on I know no other trades So youd better trade your fucking mics in for some toolboxes Cause youll never take my pride from me Itll have to be pried from me so pull out your pliers and your screwdrivers But I want you to doubt me I dont want you to buhlieve Cause this is something that I must use to succeed And if you dont like me then fuck you Self esteem must be fucking shooting throughtheroof cause trust me My skin is too thick and bullet proof to touch me I can see why the fuck I disgust you I must be allergic to failure cause every ime I come close to it I just sneeze but I just go atchoo then achieve  This is survival of the fittest This is do or die This is the winner takes it all so take it all So it take it all,,,,418,2 Chainz,We Own It (Fast &

On,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/fun/carry-on-lyrics/28837243,Well I woke up to the sound of silence the cars  Were cutting like knives in a fist fight And I found you with a bottle of wine Your head in the curtains and heart like the fourth of July  You swore and said we are not We are not shining stars This I know I never said we are  Though Ive never been through hell like that Ive closed enough windows to know you can never look back  If youre lost and alone Or youre sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground  Carry on  Carry on carry on  So I met up with some friends in the edge of the night At a bar off seventy five  And we talked and talked about how our parents will die All our neighbors and wives  But I like to think I can cheat it all To make up for the times Ive been cheated on And its nice to know When I was left for dead I was found and now I dont roam these streets I am not the ghost you want of me  If youre lost and alone or youre sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and Carry on  Woah my head is on fire But my legs are fine After all they are mine Lay your clothes down on the floor Close the door Hold the phone Show me how  No ones ever gonna stop us now  Cause we are  We are shining stars We are invincible We are who we are On our darkest day When were miles away So well come we will find our way home  If youre lost and alone Or youre sinking like a stone Carry on May your past be the sound of your feet upon the ground and Carry on  No ones ever gonna stop us now No ones ever no ones ever gonna stop no ones ever gonna stop us now No ones ever no ones ever gonna stop  no ones ever gonna stop  No ones ever gonna stop us

in the mirror Love is not just a verb its you looking for a maybe Call me crazy We can both be insane A fatal attraction is common And what we have common is pain I mean you need to hear this Love is

Nobody really seemed to care That we were living in the middle of nowhere We just figured thatâ€™s how it was And everybody else was just like us Soaking in the rain baking in the sun Donâ€™t quit til the job gets done  Thatâ€™s the only way I know Donâ€™t stop til everythingâ€™s gone Straight ahead never turn round Donâ€™t back up donâ€™t back down Full throttle wide open You get tired and you donâ€™t show it Dig a little deeper when you think you canâ€™t dig no more Thatâ€™s the only way I know  That old red dirt the first thing you learn Is you donâ€™t get nothing that you donâ€™t earn Humble pride that I grew up on You find out just how bad you want it Sun in our eyes backs to the fences We didnâ€™t know the odds were against us Hit the wall smoking and spinning Still wasnâ€™t thinking â€˜bout nothing but winning  Thatâ€™s the only way I know Donâ€™t stop til everythingâ€™s gone Straight ahead never turn round Donâ€™t back up donâ€™t back down Full throttle wide open You get tired and you donâ€™t show it Dig a little deeper when you think you canâ€™t dig no more Thatâ€™s the only way I know  Maybe thereâ€™s another path that Will get you there a little bit faster But Iâ€™m sticking with the one inside of me  Thatâ€™s the only way I know Donâ€™t stop til everythingâ€™s gone Straight ahead never turn round Donâ€™t back up donâ€™t back down Full throttle wide open You get tired and you donâ€™t show it Dig a little deeper when you think you canâ€™t dig no more Thatâ€™s the only way I  Thatâ€™s the only way I know Donâ€™t stop til everythingâ€™s gone Straight ahead never turn round Donâ€™t back up donâ€™t back down Full throttle wide open You get tired you donâ€™t show it Dig a little deeper when you think you canâ€™t dig no more Thatâ€™s the only way I know  Thats the only way I know  Thats the only way I know  The only way I know,,,,509,Ke$ha,Crazy Kids,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/ke-ha/crazy-kids-lyrics/28088894,Hello wherever you are Are you

To a longlegged model And I traded it in for a whole nother world A pirate flag and an island girl  Well my friends back home think Ive gone and lost my mind Take a sip of rum and you really would know why Jolly Roger flying on the picnic table Blender in the kitchen willin and able Dont know what makes you say What the hell But when the salt air catches a hold of that sail Something bout her makes you just wanna dance And she loves to dance  I spent my whole life running around Still let the wind kinda blow me around Well I dropped a note in a bottle To a longlegged model And I traded it

away from drugs Cause theyre not legal Then bury all your money in the backyard Like a beagle  Cause you should never trust a bank Theyve been known to fail And never travel by car a bus Boat or by rail  And dont travel by plane And dont travel at all Built a bomb shelter basement With titanium walls  And wear titanium suits In case pianos fall on ya And never go in saunas Cause theyre crawlin with piranhas  And never take the stairs Cause theyre often unsafe You only live once Dont let it go to waste  You know that we are still young So hold off on the fun Cook your meat til its done Cause you only live once  Yeah And heres another piece of advice Stay away from kids Cause their hair is filled with mad lice  Theres no such thing As too much Purell This a cautionary tale Word to George Orwell  So dont 1980 force Any plugs into sockets Always wear a chastity belt And triple lock it  Then hire a taster Make him check your food for poison And if you think your mailman is a spy Then destroy him  No blankets or pajamas They can choke you in your sleep Two words about furniture Killing machines  Board your windows up The sun is bad for your health And always wear a straight jacket So your safe from yourself  Take no chances no chances Stop freelancin right now Invest in your future Dont dilute your finances uh huh 401K make sure its low risk Then get some real estate how much 42 thirty year mortgage Thats important thats a great deal And if you cant afford it Dont forge it on your last bill Renting is for suckers right now A dependable savings And youll retire with money in your account Beast  YOLO say no no Isolate yourself And just roll solo Be carefolo You oughta look out Also stands for YOLO  You know that we are still young Burn the prints off your thumbs Then pull out all your teeth So you cant bite your tongue  Only on this earth for a short time time So dont go outside cause you dont want to die die  Just take our advice and hide And scream YOLO to the sky  You oughta look out,,,,583,Enrique Iglesias,Turn The Night Up,http://www.lyricsnmusic.com/enrique-iglesias/turn-the-night-up-lyrics/30730567,Baby you its you and me You see we can turn the night

party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And theyre all laughing As Im looking around the room But there was one thing missing And that was the moment I knew  And the hours pass by Now I just wanna be alone But your close friends always seem to know When theres something really wrong So they follow me down the hall And there in the bathroom I try not to fall apart And the sinking feeling starts As I say hopelessly He said hed be here  And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And theyre all laughing And asking me about you But there was one thing missing And that was the moment I knew  What do you say When tears are streaming down your face In front of everyone you know And what do you do when the one Who means the most to you Is the one who didnt show  You shouldve been here And I wouldve been so happy  And it was like slow motion Standing there in my party dress In red lipstick With no one to impress And

Moment I stop having fun with it Ill be done with it Im the only one thats putting shots up And like a potluck you need to come with it Dont run from it like HTown in the summer time I keep it 100 Lot of girls in my time there word to Paul Wall not one fronted I was birthed there in my first year man I know that place like I come from it Backstage at Warehouse in 09 like Is Bun coming Fuck that is any one coming fore I show up there and aint no one there These days I could probably pack it for like twenty nights if I go in there Back rub from my main thing Ive been stressed out Talking to her like back then they didnt want me Im blessed now Talking to her like this drop bet a million copies get pressed out She tell me Take a deep breath youre too worried about being the best out  Dont

once that in dire times when you need a sign thats when they appear Guess since my text message didnt resonate Ill just say it here Hate the fact my mom cooped up in her apartment telling herself That shes too sick to get dressed up and go do shit like thats true shit And all my family from the MTown that Ive been round started treating me like Im him now Like we dont know each other we aint grow together we just friends now Shit got me feeling pinned down pick the pen up and put the pen down Writing to you from a distance like a pen pal but weve been down  Dont think about it too much too

text her from time to time she a mom now I guess sometimes life forces us to calm down I told her she could live with me if she need to I got a compound but I think shes straight Cause she supported since Hot Beats right before Wayne came And got me out of the backroom where I was rapping with Jas over beats I shouldnt have in the hopes for the glory He walked right past in the hallway 3 months later Im his artist He probably wouldnt remember that story But that shit stick with me Always couldnt believe when he called me You never know it could happen to you And I just spent four Ferraris

fire below me You cannot catch me cannot hold me You cannot stop much less control me When it rains it pours when the floodgates open brace your shores  That pressure dont care when it breaks your doors Say its all you can take better take some more  Oh Cause I know what its like to test fate Had my shoulders pressed with that weight Stood up strong in spite of that hate  Oh Night gets darkest right before dawn What dont kill you makes you more strong And I been waiting for it so long  The nights go on Waiting for a light that never comes I chase the sun Waiting for a light that never comes  Oh Oh Oh Waiting for a light that never comes  When I was young they told me they said Make your bed you lie in that bed A king can only reign til instead There comes that day its off with his head  Oh The night gets darkest right before dawn What dont kill you makes you more strong Youll have my mercy then when youre gone  The nights go on Waiting for a light that never comes I chase the sun Waiting for a light that never comes  Oh Oh Oh Waiting for a light that never comes  And I told them nah you dont know me Lightning above and a fire below me You cannot catch me cannot hold me You cannot stop much less control me When it rains it pours When the floodgates open brace your shores That pressure dont care it breaks your doors Say its all you can take better take some more  Oh Oh Oh Waiting for a light that never comes  The nights go on Waiting for a light that never comes I chase the sun Waiting for a light that never comes  Oh Oh Oh Waiting for a light that never comes,,,,
