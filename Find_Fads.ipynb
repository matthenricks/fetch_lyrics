You're my sunshine after the rain  You're the cure against my fear and my pain  \\u2018Cause I'm losing my mind  When you're not around  It's all... it's all...  It's all because of you   You're my sunshine  Oh yeah...   Baby I really know by now  Since we met that day  You showed me the way  I felt it then you gave me love  I can't describe  How much I feel for you   I said baby I should have known by now  Should have been right there  Whenever you gave me love  And if only you were here  /I'd/ tell you, yes /I'd/ tell you  Oh yeah...   Chorus:  You're my sunshine after the rain  You're the cure against my fear and my pain  \\u2018Cause I'm losing my mind  When you're not around  It's all... it's all...  It's all because of you   Honestly, /could it be you and me/  Like it was before  /neither/ less or more  Cause when I close my eyes  At night I realize that no one else  Could ever take your place   I still can feel and it's so /unreal/  When you're touching me Kisses endlessly  It's just a place in the sun  Where our love's begun  I miss you... yes I miss you   Chorus  If I knew how to tell you  What's on my mind  Make you understand  Then I'd always be there  Right by your side   Chorus\"}\n",

[Bridge] Is this the way it's really going down? Is this how we say goodbye? Should have known better when you came around That you were gonna make me cry It's breaking my heart to watch you run around 'Cause I know that you're living a lie That's ok, baby, 'cause in time you will find  [Chorus] What goes around, goes around, goes around Comes all the way back around What goes around, goes around, goes around Comes all the way back around What goes around, goes around, goes around Comes all the way back around What goes around, goes around, goes around Comes all the way back around  Now, girl, I remember everything that you claimed You said that you were moving on now And maybe I should do the same Funny thing about that is  I was ready to give you my name Thought it was me and you, babe And now it's all just a shame And I guess I was wrong  Don't want to think about it Don't want to talk about it I'm just so sick about it Can't believe it's ending this way  Just so confused about it Feeling the blues about it I just can't do without ya Can you tell me, is this fair?
